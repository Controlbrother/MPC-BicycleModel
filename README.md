## Here is an implementation of part 2 using MPC and QP.


To run the code, we need to put the trajectory from part 1 into trajectories directory, name as RefTraj.mat.


Then, add directory "part2" to working path.


Then, run "simulate.m", it is quite time consuming.


At last, run "plot_video.m", set variable "video = 1" to get video under trajectories directory.


## TODO


Change the controller from MPC with QP to MPPI(Model Predictive Path Integral).
