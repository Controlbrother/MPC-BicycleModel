## Here is an implementation of part 2 using MPC and QP.


To run the code, we need to put the trajectory from part 1 into trajectories directory, name as RefTraj.mat.


Then, run "simulate.m", it will run for 100 times and save plot under data directory.


## TODO


- [ ] Work on MPC method.


- [ ] Modify current code.
